## Draconian Tweaks

Ark Survival Evolved mod created for Draconian Realms server.

### Features

#### Tek Stryder Fix

Tek Stryders as they currently exist on the server have a tendency to cause crashes. This mitigates those crashes by hiding the evil button. All stryders spawned after the installation of the mod will have this effect. Pre-existing stryders will need to be fed a Stryder Repair Kit.

Engrams:
Stryder Repair Kit - Unlocked at Level 1 - Costs 0 Engram Points
- 10 Metal Ingot
- 25 Electronics
- 50 Element Dust
