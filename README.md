# Features
## Tek Stryder Fix
Tek Stryders as they currently exist have a tendency to cause crashes. This mitigates those crashes by hiding the evil button. All stryders should have this buff effect added on, retroactively. The repair kit consumable is provided for the strange case that a stryder doesn't have the buff. Feed it to a stryder to apply the buff to it.
